		   		    "Message": "Car is already present in the parking lot.",
				    "Allotted slot no is": 1
			     }

2. Unpark a car
  	      1) ip(slot_no) : 1
             Op: {
		          "Message": "Car has been successfully unparked"
	         	  }

          2) ip: 1
             Op: {
 		              "Message": "This slot is already free"
            	  }

3. Get car no by slot no
 		 1) ip(slot_no) : 1
 		    op:  {
   			    	 "Given slot no is": "1",
			         "Car parked at given slot is": 1998
			     }
         2) ip: 2
	        op: {
   		        	 "Message": "Entered slot is free"
			    }

4. Get slot no by car no
  		1) ip(car_no) : 1998
 		   op: {
    				"Given car no is": "1998",
			        "Allotted slot no is": 1
			   }
        2) ip: 2031
           op: {
	                "Message": "Car is not present in the parking lot"
	           }


5. Set parking lot size
	1) ip(size) : 10
 	   op: {
    			"Message": "Parking Lot size has been set successfully"
		   }

6. Set Rate Limiter parameters
        1) ip(window and limit) : 10 and 5
	       op: {
		           "Message": "Rate Limiter parameters have been set successfully."
		       }


###Testcases for Rate Limiter
 -Here window is time in seconds and limit is requestsLimit, so lets say if window=5sec and limit=2
   then rate limiter will allow first 2 requests  5 sec and it will reject further requests,

Params (window=5sec and limit = 2 ), Op is:
{
    "Given slot no is": "1",
    "Car parked at given slot is": 1998
}
{
    "Given slot no is": "1",
    "Car parked at given slot is": 1998
}
{
    "Message": "Request rejected."
}
{
    "Message": "Request rejected."
}
{
    "Message": "Request rejected."
}
{
    "Given slot no is": "1",
    "Car parked at given slot is": 1998
}


Note: In all api’s if input is not given in the request body it will give “Please Enter valid input” message.
